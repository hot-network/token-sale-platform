    question: 'What is the HOT Token Sale Platform?',
    answer: 'This platform is a dedicated, mainnet-ready launchpad for the HOT token presale. It allows users to securely purchase HOT tokens before they are listed on public exchanges and provides tools for post-sale trading.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I participate in the presale?',
    answer: 'Simply connect a Solana-compatible wallet (like Phantom or Solflare), choose your payment method (SOL or USDC), enter the amount you wish to contribute, and approve the transaction. Your purchased tokens will be locked until the sale ends.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What payment methods are accepted?',
    answer: 'We accept both native SOL and SPL USDC for presale contributions. Please note that you will always need a small amount of SOL in your wallet to cover network transaction fees (gas), even when paying with USDC.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the total supply of HOT tokens?',
    answer: 'The total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens, ensuring no future inflation. This finite supply is designed to create long-term value as the network grows.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the team anonymous?',
    answer: 'Our core team is comprised of experienced developers and strategists from the Web3 space. We are currently semi-anonymous but will be pursuing a phased-doxxing strategy at key project milestones to build long-term trust and transparency with our community.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Where will HOT be listed after the presale?',
    answer: 'We are in advanced discussions with several top-tier decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Solana. An official announcement regarding our first listing partners will be made as the presale concludes to ensure a smooth market debut.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after the presale concludes?',
    answer: 'After the sale, you will be able to claim your purchased HOT tokens directly to your wallet via the \'Claim Tokens\' button. Simultaneously, the \'Trade\' tab will be enabled, allowing for market buying and selling.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this platform secure?',
    answer: 'Yes. Security is paramount. All transactions are conducted directly on the Solana blockchain from your self-custodial wallet. We never have access to your private keys or funds. Every transaction is transparent and verifiable on-chain.'
